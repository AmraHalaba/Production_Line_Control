# Production_Line_Control
This project is still in a development phase. 
Functionalities available up until now relate to documenting the problems related to the production process. Users are enabled to add/update/delete/view products, production lines, production categories, reports, and problems. 
The plan is to work on the user profile app and enable the dashboard for communcation on the production line problems between the staff from different production lines (resemblance of a social network).
The frontend is done with HTML5 / Bootstrap / JQuery, backend with Django web framework, integrated with PostgreSQL database.
